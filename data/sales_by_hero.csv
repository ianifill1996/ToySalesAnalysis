"Insight: Captain America and Spider-Man are the top revenue-generating heroes, with Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, and Black Panther following. While Black Panther is in the top 5, his earnings are noticeably lower, suggesting room for targeted promotions or bundling to boost sales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
